- stone table view

- allow gary to confirm stones on vault's behalf

- make a way to create splits and add new packages as the child of the split
- make a way to create splits into stones
- when splitting -> the parent ownership gets expired
- permissions for creating split parcels

- generate stone ID
- make receipt ID and parcel ID unique. autogenerate them?

- allow select group to confirm GIA/goldway user receipts

### done
- in the transfer thing. default to only showing their stuff
- parcel admin view has split parcels in it
