### basics
- special users: vault, split, admin


### questions
- kyc will be done in remarks. we will have a checklist
- would you ever return parts of a consignment? ie. one parcel out of 3


### todo:
- start transfer should have search and select like user select
    - cant tell if have confirmed stones or not
- splits- why does the more descriptive error not show up
- stones should have location and action to return to vault
- vaultmasters can also split even if they dont own the thing
- data entry needs to be able to split even if they dont own the thing
- make sure splits add up
- filter by user thing
- move receipts to customers


- backend to confirm stones
- backend to return stones to vault
- better error page for split (eg: not confirmed transfer yet, you are not the owner so you can't split)
- split parcel -> add. u can choose who the user who split the parcel is- instead it should just autosave as the logged in user


- make the 2. parcel info into an excel thing and have the return to vault button in the list view as well
- stone table view

- allow gary to confirm stones on vault's behalf

- make a way to create splits and add new packages as the child of the split
- make a way to create splits into stones
- when splitting -> the parent ownership gets expired
- permissions for creating split parcels

- generate stone ID
- make receipt ID and parcel ID unique. autogenerate them?

- allow select group to confirm GIA/goldway user receipts
- fix the search bar in the transfer thing


### done
- in the transfer thing. default to only showing their stuff
- parcel admin view has split parcels in it
- take out user / received by option from parcel. instead track ownership transfer

### not doing
- link parcel or split parcel to stone <- fixed by new splitting mechanism
